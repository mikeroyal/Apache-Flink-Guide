## Reinforcement Learning Learning Resources

[Reinforcement Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning#toc-deep-learn-md_Q_Of3) is a subset of machine learning, which is a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain,though, far from matching its ability. This allows the neural networks to "learn" from a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward. The Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

## Bioinformatics Learning Resources

[Bioinformatics](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Bioinformatics) is a field of computational science that has to do with the analysis of sequences of biological molecules. This usually refers to genes, DNA, RNA, or protein, and is particularly useful in comparing genes and other sequences in proteins and other sequences within an organism or between organisms, looking at evolutionary relationships between organisms, and using the patterns that exist across DNA and protein sequences to figure out what their function is.
